### Constructors in Java
### Adapted from [JavaTpoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-constructor)
* In Java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method. 
* It is called when an instance of the class is created.
* It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object.
* Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.
* It is called constructor because it constructs the values at the time of object creation.
### Rules for creating Java constructor
#### There are two rules defined for the constructor.
#### Constructor name must be the same as its class name
* A Constructor must have no explicit return type
* A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized
